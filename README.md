# Redux To-do App

A basic To-do app using vanilla JS and Redux.

## Project Aims

This project's main focus is on learning how to use the Redux library for state management. Additionally, I've built some utility functions to help keep the code clean and readable. This project is a training exercise before implementing Redux into a larger, React-based project in future.
